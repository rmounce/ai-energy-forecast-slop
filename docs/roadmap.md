## Design Principles

**Predict distributions, not averages.** Battery economics are asymmetric — a model trained
to minimise MSE smooths out spikes. The pipeline predicts q5/q10 through q90/q95/q99 at
every interval. Financial regret (simulated $/day vs oracle) — not nMAPE — is the headline
evaluation metric.

**Separate concerns cleanly.** Forecaster forecasts. Optimizer optimizes. Execution layer
acts. These must not bleed into each other.

**The spike gap in TFT is structural, not fixable by tuning.** LightGBM wins on spikes
because PREDISPATCH is its direct input feature. TFT's advantage is long-horizon baseload
accuracy and calibrated uncertainty. The two-tier architecture separates these roles rather
than trying to solve both with one model.

**Raw PREDISPATCH is biased.** AEMO's forecasts have systematic errors during demand peaks
and constraint events. The pipeline corrects this explicitly via the Phase 1a OOF debiaser.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1a | PREDISPATCH debiaser (LightGBM OOF) | ✅ Done — MAE 325→65 $/MWh |
| 1b | TFT price model Run 011b | ✅ Done — debiased decoder, q5/10/50/90/95/99 |
| 2 | Tactical LightGBM Run 001 + P5MIN backfill | ✅ Done — q50 MAE 21.1 vs 30.7 baseline |
| 3 | Dispatch simulator baseline | ✅ Done — LightGBM +5.9% regret reduction vs P5MIN |
| 4 | Conformal calibration (Tier 1) | ✅ Done — spike q95 0.750→0.821 |
| 5 (partial) | Production routing, combined shadow sensors | ✅ Done — live in HA |
| **6** | **Holistic dispatch simulation** | **Baseline established** — TFT source pending |
| **8** | **Test framework** | **Layer 1 complete** (29 tests) — Layer 2 gate wired, pending TFT source |
| 5 (remainder) | HA tail-risk automations, CI/CD gate, model updates | Paused — pending Phase 6+8 |
| 7 | Event-driven predict service | Deferred — after Phase 8 |

**Hard gate:** Phase 6 and Phase 8 must both pass before Phase 5 remainder resumes.
Reason: without a financial baseline and regression tests, pipeline changes cannot be
validated against the ultimate goal (profit).

**Phase 6 baseline** (July 2025–March 2026, 811 windows, price-only LP MPC):
- Oracle: $6.00/day all, $11.97/day spike
- LightGBM legacy: $2.99/day all, $6.82/day spike (positive — Amber APF seeding works)
- P5MIN naive: ~$0/day (expected)

Remaining for full Phase 6+8: add Tier 1+2 AI source via retrospective TFT batch
inference, then enable `test_ai_pipeline_meets_financial_gate`.

## CI/CD: Two-Tier Promotion Gate (Phase 5 sub-task 6)

Applies to weekly model retrains. Not yet implemented — deferred to after Phase 6+8 gate.

**Gate 1 — Rolling window (14 days):** Simulated financial regret on the most recent 14
days must match or beat the incumbent model.

**Gate 2 — Golden set (partitioned, never contaminated):**
- **Set A** (training allowed, decay floor ≥50%): June 2022 Energy Crisis
- **Set B** (eval-only, never trained): February 2024 SA Storm Islanding event

Set A and Set B must remain mutually exclusive at every retrain. The gate tests
generalisation to unseen regime-change events, not memorisation of Set A.

## Training: Event-Stratified Importance Weighting

**Problem with pure exponential decay:** Downweights 2022 energy crisis events (market
suspensions, extreme spikes, deep negatives) precisely when their training signal is most
valuable. Spike physics do not change over time; only baseload bid-stack behaviour does.

**Solution (implemented):**
- Baseload regime (−$50 to $150): exponential decay, half-life ~90 days
- Extreme events (price < −$50 or > $150): decay floor at 50% of most-recent-sample weight

This prevents catastrophic forgetting of 2022 crisis data while keeping recent market
dynamics dominant. Implemented in `train/train_tft_price.py` and `train/train_lgbm_tactical.py`.

## Execution Layer

**EMHASS (baseload arbitrage):** Receives Tier 2 q50 price vector via
`sensor.ai_price_forecast`. LP maximises daily arbitrage net of cycle degradation
(~$0.05/kWh marginal penalty).

**HA tail-risk overrides (Phase 5 sub-task 4, not yet implemented):**
1. Spike defence: when `q95 − q50` exceeds opportunity cost of holding charge →
   set `backup_reserve = 100%` to prevent premature discharge before a spike.
2. Oversupply capture: when `q50 − q5` justifies forced grid charging ahead of EMHASS
   schedule → override charge threshold.

**EMHASS dual variable (Phase 5 sub-task 5):** The mathematically correct denominator
for opportunity cost is the shadow price of the SOC constraint (`constraint.pi` in PuLP).
EMHASS does not expose this via API. Preferred path: fork/upstream to extract it.
Fallback: two LP solves with finite difference (2× overhead).

## Known Open Issues

**Tier 2 lower-tail calibration:** q05/q10 are structurally biased — log-scaling compresses
negative values. Do not use Tier 2 q05/q10 for dispatch thresholds until conformal
calibration is applied. Upper tail (q90/q95/q99) is well-calibrated.

**NEM intervention pricing:** `is_intervention` boolean must mask `aemo_divergence` to 0
in Tier 1 when AEMO issues market directions. Also: provisional vs final settlement
corrections (up to 4 days post-interval) not yet tracked in ingest pipeline.

**Reserve margin for Tier 2 decoder:** SevenDayOutlook demand is biased low during
heatwaves — exactly when reserve margin tightens. Adding rolling actual-vs-forecast
demand divergence as an encoder feature would help. Blocked on SDO capacity column
being absent from current parquet export.

**Debiaser endogeneity:** PREDISPATCH debiaser trained on endogenous targets (actual
prices are partly caused by generators responding to PREDISPATCH). Not fixable; document,
monitor residuals, retrain aggressively during structural transition periods.
